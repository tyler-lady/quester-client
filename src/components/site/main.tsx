        <p>Here we have strived not to make a simple character creator, but to create an imaginative, user-driven environment for users to adventure with their created characters. In other-words, a text-browser-based RPG.</p>
        <p>Version 1 is meant to bring the capabilites to create, view, and modify a user's characters.</p>
        <p>Version 2 will push the capability to use your character in a simple Main Quest format. The roadmap following that will be giving users the ability to create quests & adventures to play on their own. We hope to have stat-checks, variable endings, and even enemies to one day fight.</p>
